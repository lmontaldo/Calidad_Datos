So in all, we have had only two weeks delay in teaching our curriculum. Waht we are now planning for is a possible closure, we do this by developing all the learning resources to be delivered online, by TV, by radio and by hard copy for parents to pick up from schools. We hope these measures will be effectively used to deliver our curriculum in case of a lockdown in the future. Meanwhile its business as usual, but we are preparing ourselves for a different way of delivering teaching and learning.  Our borders are still closed, and if they remain so till end of Nov, our school curriculum will be close to being fully delivered.;;;;;;;;;;;

Este bloqueo impuesto por EEUU provoca el cerco a la adquisición y uso masivo a las tecnologías, al flujo de información y al acceso a internet para los cubanos.   El bloqueo impuesto por Estados Unidos constituye la principal barrera para el desarrollo de las TIC en Cuba, con afectaciones millonarias recogidas cada año en el Informe sobre la resolución de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas «Necesidad de poner fin al bloqueo económico, comercial y financiero impuesto por los Estados Unidos de América contra Cuba».    Ante la pandemia el Covid-19, el Ministerio de Educación de la República de Cuba, decidió el 24 de marzo de 2020, la paralización temporal del curso escolar, para lograr el mayor aislamiento social, cumpliendo de esta forma con las indicaciones de la máxima dirección del gobierno cubano, como una de las medidas para frenar el contagio.  Teniendo en cuenta la afectación por varias semanas de actividades lectivas y las limitaciones existentes en Cuba para la conectividad en internet y uso de las redes sociales; se comenzó a desarrollar una programación televisiva para orientar por niveles educativos, grados y asignaturas, a los docentes, estudiantes y familias en los objetivos y contenidos previstos a vencer en la etapa, con la utilización de los materiales escolares que cuentan en sus hogares.  Esto se realiza por dos canales educativos existentes en Cuba y se incorporó el canal Tele Rebelde, de la Televisión Cubana, de conjunto con CINESOFT, entidad con experticia en el ámbito del desarrollo de software educativos. También se utilizan el Portal CubaEduca y la plataforma YouTube del Canal Educativo.  Para apoyar todo este proceso de teleclases que se desarrollan en su gran mayoría en vivo, con los equipos técnicos del Instituto Cubano de Radio y Televisión (ICRT), y que pueden mantenerse como buenas prácticas, para otras situaciones excepcionales y otras de apoyo al proceso docente-educativo, se hace necesario la adquisición de determinados recursos para la grabación, edición y producción de estos materiales educativos. Con el equipamiento actual, no se puede asumir toda la carga que conlleva la elaboración de materiales educativos para los niveles desde la Primera Infancia hasta el nivel superior.   El bloqueo impide a Cuba adquirir tecnologias, acceder con mayores prestaciones y calidad a internet entre otros. Durante la crisis del Covid, las medidas cohersitivas que EEUU impone unilateralnete a Cuba  han sido recrudecidas.";;;;;;;;;;;

With 212 schools distributed to all the inhabited islands, separated by the vast ocean, reaching out to all the students is a big challenge. Though this problem can be addressed with the establishment of an effective virtual learning system, this idea is quite novel to our relatively young school system.        There are households that do not have access to a device that can be used for remote learning. Internet is expensive and connectivity is low, especially in the remote islands. In order to prepare online content, we need to train teachers in theory and delivery of content creation, editing and posting on various media outlets. These are areas for which we seek support.         There is also the issue of public awareness. Many parents were asking the government to close schools long before there was community spread. Parents were stressed as they lacked the knowledge and means to adjust their schedules to fit in their children’s remote learning sessions.  We need assistance in developing awareness programs and get them prepared for the new methods of learning.         Another challenge we foresee is the shortage of trained teachers. We heavily rely on teachers from neighboring countries, especially for the higher grades.  There is a high chance that they may want to return back to their countries as the Covid-19 situation develops. 83% of local teachers are females. Most of them reside in the densely populated and expensive capital city and teach one-third of our student population. With jobs being lost from other sectors, there is a high chance of local teachers migrating to their islands. Thus,  we seek assistance in training more teachers to fill in the positions that can become vacant.         To prepare for the new normal, the schools will need the help of counsellors and health assistants. These are areas that need to be developed. Only 28 percent of government schools have trained counsellors, and 27 percent of schools have health assistants.         Thus, Maldives is in dire need of trained counsellors and health assistants. Even the employed counselors and health assistants need special training to prepare them for the challenges of living with Covid-19. As the demographics show that these jobs are dominated by females, this is an opportunity to retrain females losing their jobs and those who want to take up a career to support their families.         We also need to strengthen the wash facilities in all the schools. There are schools that do not have good wash facilities for teachers as well as students.           All in all, our school system is not well prepared for this pandemic and its magnitude. The pandemic is unprecedented and its fall-out can extend for many months, possibly years. Considering the heavy reliance of the Maldivian economy on tourism and the tourism sector being most affected by the pandemic, we are afraid that we may not have access to the domestic funds that were available for education.;;;;;;;;;;;

The package includes a communication and collaboration platform - Teams - which enables teachers to stay in contact and teach their students. Students can learn and receive all necessary information through using this tool. The Ministry of Human Capacities offers advices on digital education for teachers and students via the website of Educational Authority. Educators can find a list of suggested IT solutions. For all secondary educational institutions, KRÉTA (basic system for administration in public education) is the official channel, therefore students and their guardians or parents can be informed on centrally determined decisions and further actions via central messages on the bulletin board of each class. Teachers can give individually homework through the KRÉTA system. Both teachers and parents receive notification of the homework. After completing the homework, the student can submit the homework to the teacher's KRÉTA account or upload it to the selected lesson through the KRÉTA system. The KRÉTA system is IT-capable to support the upload of online learning materials, has a direct information channel and also allows to attach e-learning materials. Teachers are also free to use other platforms, considering digital safety recommendations (available at the site of the Educational Authority at: https://www.oktatas.hu/kozneveles/ajanlas_tantermen_kivuli_digitalis_munkarendhez/informatikai_biztonsag).

Where special aptitude tests are required, these are organised in modified forms considering safety as a priority.;;;"In Hungary, schools have not been closed down, but a transmission to a new work schedule, the so called digital work schedule outside the classroom occurred. Therefore, school leaders remained on duty, and in case it was needed, teachers have had the opportunity to enter the school buildings for the purpose of digital education. Similarly, school infrastructure could be made available for those students who had no other access to ICT tools; this was organised with high attention to safety requirements. For kindergarten and primary school enrolment, as well as for secondary school application, a simplified process (eliminating personal presence or contact) has been introduced. As for public education, all student excursions, camps have been postponed or suspended. The Government of Hungary empowered the competent Minister to suspend international mobility programmes in their area of competence.";;;;;;;;;;;

Some examples are the lack of connectivity, no credit for internet, old phone and even unupdated application may affect the effectiveness of distance learning.     2. Children still need guidance directly from the teacher and at the same time need role models.   3. The lack of economic affordability as Indonesia has very unequal distribution of wealth. So, not every parent in the village may afford to buy internet credit even phone/computer/tablet to take part in online learning.     For parents who have adequate education in knowledge and creativity, it might not be a problem when their children are at home wants to know a lot of things and ask questions. But for parents whose children go to school on the periphery, with minimal education, knowledge and creativity, it will be very difficult when their sons and daughters ask difficult questions from information sources such as books or TV.;Not recorded;;;;Not recorded;;;;;;
